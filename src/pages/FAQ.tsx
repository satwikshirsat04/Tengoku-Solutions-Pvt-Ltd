          question: "What is biochar and how does it work?",
          answer: "Biochar is a carbon-rich charcoal produced from organic waste through pyrolysis. It enhances soil fertility by improving water retention, nutrient availability, and microbial activity while sequestering carbon for centuries."
        },
        {
          question: "How is Tengoku Solutions different from other biochar providers?",
          answer: "We specialize in customized biochar formulations tailored to specific soil types and crops, backed by 15+ years of agricultural research and sustainable production methods."
        },
        {
          question: "Where do you operate?",

        },
        {
          question: "How do I choose the right biochar for my needs?",
          answer: "Our agricultural experts will analyze your soil type, crops, and local conditions to recommend the optimal biochar formulation and application rate."
        },
        {
          question: "What certifications do your products have?",
          answer: "Our biochar is IBI certified, meets ISO standards, and carries organic certifications where applicable."

    {
      name: "Application & Usage",
      items: [
        {
          question: "How do I apply biochar to my soil?",
          answer: "Application methods vary by crop and soil type. Generally, we recommend mixing biochar with compost or fertilizer before incorporating it into the top 6-12 inches of soil at rates between 5-20% by volume."
        },
        {
          question: "How long until I see results from biochar?",
          answer: "Initial improvements in water retention may appear within weeks, while full benefits for soil fertility and crop yields typically emerge over 1-2 growing seasons as the biochar integrates with your soil ecosystem."
        },
        {
          question: "Can biochar be used with other soil amendments?",
          answer: "Yes, biochar works synergistically with organic fertilizers and compost. We often recommend pre-charging biochar with nutrients before application."

    {
      name: "Technical & Scientific",
      items: [
        {
          question: "What is the carbon sequestration potential of biochar?",
          answer: "Our biochar sequesters approximately 3 tons of COâ‚‚ equivalent per ton of biochar applied, with stability in soils for hundreds to thousands of years."
        },
        {
          question: "How does biochar improve water retention?",
          answer: "Biochar's porous structure acts like a sponge, holding up to 5 times its weight in water while improving soil structure to prevent runoff and evaporation."
        },
        {
          question: "What research supports your claims?",
          answer: "Our products are backed by peer-reviewed studies from our R&D team and university partners. We can provide technical documentation and case studies upon request."
